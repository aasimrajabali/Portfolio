This folder contains machine learning files:

machinelearning_1.py: This file uses the iris flower dataset and is intended for practice of machine learning algorithms. This file loads the dataset from a url, prints its shape, head, descriptions, and class distribution.

In addition, the file will run multiple plots and graphs (Box and whisker, Histogram, Scatterplot)

Uses the following algorithms for comparison and predictions: 

Logistic Regression
Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
K-Neighbors Classifier
Classification and Regression Tree (CART)
Gaussian Naive Bayes (NB)
Support Vector Machine (SVM)


The RSS feed is from BBC news and covers US events.
This is a live feed, so the header contains BBC News along with a constantly changing date to 
show when the RSS was last modified. The previous and next buttons to move across to different feeds
are used through keyboard interactivity: by pressing the left or right arrow keys the user can switch between
feeds. The headings are color coded depending on the type of heading it is (ie. if the article includes a 
video the link is blue, otherwise the link is green). When hovering over each title with the mouse, the item's
description appears. Also, when clicking the item title, the link to the article's url opens up a web browser containing
that article.

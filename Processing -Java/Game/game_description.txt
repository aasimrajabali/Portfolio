***DESCRIPTION FILE***
The game consists of you, the character, trying to grab food while dodging enemies. As
you grab more food you get bigger, thus making it harder to avoid enemies. Whenever the 
player gets to 15 points, they win, and if they get touched by an enemy they lose.

The Rules of Play are as follows:
1. Grab the food to get points; each food is 1 point.
2. If you touch an enemy, the game is over.
3. Each time you grab food, you expand.
4. There are boundaries, so the player cannot move past
   the canvas limits.

Keyboard Inputs:
1. Up, Right, Left, and Down arrow keys move the player (4 inputs)
2. Pressing any key (other than arrow keys) allows the player to stop
   their momentum.
3. 'r' to restart the game whenever the player wins/loses.

# Object Oriented Programming - Python
All current OOP projects were made from coursework related projects in an Elements of Software Design from the University of Texas at Austin. The projects during this course focused on creating binary search trees, geometric/sparse matrix classes, graph traversal, and using turtle graphics to create abstract art.

# Processing - Java
[Processing](https://processing.org/) was the main focus in my Graphics Design course at the University of Texas at Austin. The scripting is in Java, and the main projects are a live newsfeed, snake game, photo filter, and a water simulation project.

# Python
Focuses on algorithm development and implementation through many different cases. This folder contains many files where I would create small programs and design algorithms to solve problems such as identifying a credit card by its number or solving a word search puzzle. 

# Web Development
Each project contains a website that implements HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to either test a problem (JavaScript Password Validator using regular expressions) or make a puzzle (Memory Game using Jquery). Other more complex projects contain PHP to help store cookies and user information (Mock Website).
